         <h1>Ode to the Cosmos</h1>
         <p>A poem I wrote about my love of astronomy.</p>

<p>O, universe, utterly ubiquitous.
You are my sole impetus.
I find my focus stolen,
Mind filling, almost swollen,
With all the wonders and secrets not wholly uncovered.
All the creatures and planets we haven’t discovered.
Your expanses, impossible to fully traverse,
Leaves mankind feeling quite adverse.
But, those lucky few sailors of space,
Explore your depths with courage and grace.
Traveling to worlds yet to be,
Oh, how lucky, couldn’t it be me?
You’re filled with galaxies, nebulae, star clusters,
You encompass mankind and all our blusters.
Supernovae, stellar explosions, outshine whole galaxies,
Give thoughts to blackholes and alternate realities.
Whatever the answer, whatever the question.
It will only better my impression.
So tell me your secrets, all you have seen,
From suns to stars and what lies between.</p>

<p>O, space, splendiferous stars.
From probes on comets to water on mars.
You could be teeming with life, filled to the brim,
Civilizations created and destroyed on a whim.
Such simple minds as ours can’t hope to understand you,
Constantly learning, reaching, striving for a breakthrough.
Gas giants, red dwarfs, and planetoids,
Pulsars, frozen water, and asteroids.
You, so vast, have captured my curiosity.
So I will pursue you with unending ferocity.
As I learn more about you, my interest locks,
On theories of aliens and the Fermi Paradox.
To think of other creatures like me,
Curious about aliens and how they came to be.
Life should be abundant, you have so much potential.
Research and study is becoming essential.
There may be life here on Jupiter’s moons,
On Ganymede with oceans, beneath great icy dunes.
Traces of water on mars, ancient bacteria,
In terms of life, they meet all the criteria.</p>

<p>O, cosmos, celestially churning.
You light a fire in me, always burning.
You, home to all that is known,
and all the stars that in the night sky shone.
Your secrets lead to hundreds of theories,
yet remain unanswered, man’s greatest queries.
With or without us, time marches on.
Thirteen billion years since your first dawn.
Eons ago you expanded from the initial singularity.
I wish someone could give me some clarity.
Every bit of knowledge raises us higher,
To learn more about you is my greatest desire.
How can you not capture everyone’s attention?
Sharing my passion is my other intention.
To understand what we are, we must know where we’re from.
All of us are different, unique as they come.
The secrets of life and creation remain mystery,
Whoever finds out will go down in history.
All that was, is, or will be was born from you.
We will never cease to search for what is true.</p>

<p>O, sea of shimmering stars and glistening galaxies.
In you we’re contained, with all our fallacies.
The night sky, filled with suns and constellations.
So far above the quarrels of our nations.
You hold more than I will ever know,
Even more than you could ever show.
Our nearest neighbors are light years away,
So sadly here I will have to stay.
Your greatness can hardly be shown,
With words and paper alone.
But still, I will try to show you my passion,
As, above me, stars are clashing.
But, after billions of years, we can reap what we sowed,
As we venture into space, and take what we’re owed.
Be prepared, as we learn more and more,
We want to see it, all you have in store.
Before you know it, we’ll be off to new stars.
Maybe I’ll see when we colonize mars.
When we explore deep space, I won’t be around,
But, I’ll learn all I can, and share what I’ve found.
So, one day, others who share my love,
Can use my work, and ascend to stars above.</p>
