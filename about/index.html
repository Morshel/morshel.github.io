         <h1>About me</h1>
         

<p>Hey! I&rsquo;m Morgan Hayes, an 18 year old artist, poet, and animator. I am going off to college next year, and this website showcases most of my important work.</p>

<p>Art has always been a passion of mine. More recently, poetry and creative writing have joined it. My dream is to have a career that can fulfill my creative side, as well as my interests in science and math. I have very strong backgrounds in both, and have been interested in learning whatever I can get my hands on all my life.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Here, I&rsquo;ll talk more on my history with these subjects.</p>

<h4 id="art">Art</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve dabbled in art ever since I was a toddler, and more recently, I&rsquo;ve gotten a tablet to take those interests digital. When I was younger, I would copy and trace frames from the cartoons and anime I would watch. That quickly developed into making my own characters. Around middle school, my interest in art really picked up as I joined a club on drawing manga, and I got a Wacom Intuos tablet.</p>

<p>In the past year or so, I&rsquo;ve improved my art drastically. So far, I&rsquo;ve been almost entirely self-taught and mostly learning through trial and error. I would love to expand more, and really learn the fundamentals of art.</p>

<h4 id="poetry">Poetry</h4>

<p>I actually disliked poetry in general until my ninth grade English class. Analyzing poems, something which was the bane of my existence in eighth grade, had become much more interesting under my new teacher. For one assignment, we had to write an ode to something we enjoyed. This was the very first time I wrote any poetry, and surprisingly had a knack for it. It was over 80 lines, and my teacher told me it was publishable work. Since then, it has been a huge passion of mine alongside art. That poem, the Ode to the Cosmos, can be found under the poetry section.</p>

<p>My more recent poems have been about my personal experiences with life, loss, and mental illness, as well as a variety of social issues. While art is usually a way for me to express my positive emotions, I tend to get out the negative through poetry.</p>

<h4 id="animation">Animation</h4>

<p>Animating is an extremely new hobby of mine. I started in October of 2018, after finding a song that really resonated with me. Through the use of several online gif-making resources and my brother&rsquo;s editing software, I completed my first picture music video (PMV). It was very spur-of-the-moment, I decided I wanted to create one, and 24 hours later I had a little over a minute of footage.</p>

<p>Very shortly after, I made my first actual animation, using Firealpaca and Final Cut Pro. Since then, I&rsquo;ve done several smaller animation memes (which are short videos to the clips of audio that animators make under the same theme, with their own unique take and characters). I am currently working on a slightly more ambitious long-term project.</p>
